#Foodle

## Decription
An app that lets you sort restaurants by new experiences and then places the restaurant on a map 

## User Story
As an avid restaurant goer, i get tired of eating from the same places. I want an app that suggests foods I have not eaten this week. I also want to be able to choose restaurants based on proximity.
